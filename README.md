# WireKit

This wireframing kit provides easy-to-use wireframe templates as a starting point for developing both web and mobile applications. There is a __web__ and a __mobile (iOS)__ version of the kit. Both contain symbols, atoms, elements and example screens / landing pages, which you can drag and drop or adapt for your particular use case. The kit also gives a brief introduction to typography and typical grid settings for mobile and desktop applications.

Happy prototyping!
